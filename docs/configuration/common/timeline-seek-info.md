?> For optimal UX, keep the settings for the mini-timeline in the `live` and
`media_viewer` identical. Dragging the timeline may cause the card to change
between the `live` view and `media_viewer` based views as the user pans between
the past and present -- if the settings are different the timeline must "reset".
