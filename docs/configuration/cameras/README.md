# Cameras

The `cameras` block configures a list of cameras the card should support. The first listed camera is the default.

```yaml
cameras:
  - [...camera 0 (default camera)...]
  - [...camera 1...]
  - [...camera 2...]
```

The `cameras_global` block can be used to set defaults across multiple cameras.

```yaml
cameras_global:
  # [...]
```

## `capabilities`

The `capabilities` block allows selected disabling of auto-detected camera capabilities. This is rarely used, with substreams being a notable exception.

```yaml
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.office
    capabilities:
      # [...]
```

| Option           | Default | Description                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `disable`        |         | A list of camera capabilities to disable. By default all capabilities supported by the camera are enabled. |
| `disable_except` |         | A list of camera capabilities to leave enabled if supported. Everything else will be disabled.             |

### Capabilities

| Capability            | Purpose                                                  |

| `substream`           | The camera can be used as a substream on another camera. |

## `cast`

The `cast` block configures how a camera is cast / sent to media players.

```yaml
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.office
    cast:
      # [...]
```

| Option      | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dashboard` |            | Configuration for the dashboard to cast. See below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `method`    | `standard` | Whether to use `standard` media casting to send the live view to your media player, or to instead cast a `dashboard` you have manually setup. Casting a dashboard supports a much wider variety of video media, including low latency video providers (e.g. `go2rtc`). This setting has no effect on casting non-live media. |

See the [dashboard method cast example](../../examples.md?id=cast-a-dashboard).

### Dashboard Configuration

```yaml
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.office
    cast:
      dashboard:
        # [...]
```

| Option           | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dashboard_path` |         | A required field that specifies the name of the dashboard to cast. You can see this name in your HA URL when you visit the dashboard.                                     |
| `view_path`      |         | A required field that specifies view/"tab" on that dashboard to cast. This is the value you have specified in the `url` field of the view configuration on the dashboard. |

## `dependencies`

The `dependencies` block configures other cameras as dependents of this camera. Dependent cameras have their media fetched and merged with this camera by default, and offer their respective live views as 'substreams' of the main (depended upon) camera. Configuration is under:

```yaml
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.office
    dependencies:
      # [...]
```

| Option        | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `all_cameras` | `false` | Shortcut to specify all other cameras as dependent cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `cameras`     |         | An optional list of other camera identifiers (see `id` parameter). If specified the card will fetch media for this camera and _also_ recursively for the named cameras by default. Live views for the involved cameras will be available as 'substreams' of the main (depended upon) camera. All dependent cameras must themselves be a configured camera in the card. This can be useful to group events for cameras that are close together, to show multiple related live views, to always have clips/snapshots show fully merged events across all cameras or to show events for the `birdseye` camera that otherwise would not have events itself. |

## `dimensions`

The `dimensions` block configures the dimensions and layout of media of a given camera (see [Card Dimensions](../dimensions.md) to set the dimensions of the whole card and not just a single camera).

```yaml
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.office
    dimensions:
      # [...]
```

| Option         | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `aspect_ratio` |         | An optional aspect ratio for media from this camera which will be used in `live` or media viewer related views (e.g. `clip`, `snapshot` and `recording`). Format is the same as the parameter of the same name under the [dimensions block](../dimensions.md) (which controls dimensions for the whole card), e.g. `16 / 9`. |
| `layout`       |         | How the media should be laid out _within_ the camera dimensions. See below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Layout Configuration

The `layout` block configures the fit and position of the media _within_ the camera dimensions (in order to control the dimensions for the whole card see [the card dimensions configuration](../dimensions.md) ).

```yaml
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.office
    dimensions:
      layout:
        # [...]
```

| Option     | Default   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `fit`      | `contain` | If `contain`, the media is contained within the card and letterboxed if necessary. If `cover`, the media is expanded proportionally (i.e. maintaining the media aspect ratio) until the camera/card dimensions are fully covered. If `fill`, the media is stretched to fill the camera/card dimensions (i.e. ignoring the media aspect ratio). See [CSS object-fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) for technical details and a visualization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `pan`      |           | A dictionary that may contain an `x` and `y` percentage (`0` - `100`) to control the position of the media when "digitally zoomed in" (see `zoom` parameter). This can be effectively used to "pan"/cut the media shown. A value of `0` means maximally to the left or top of the media, a value of `100` means maximally to the right or bottom of the media. See visualizations below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `position` |           | A dictionary that may contain an `x` and `y` percentage (`0` - `100`) to control the position of the media when the fit is `cover` (for other values of `fit` this option has no effect). This can be effectively used to "pan"/cut the media shown. At any given time, only one of `x` and `y` will have an effect, depending on whether media width is larger than the camera/card dimensions (in which case `x` controls the position) or the media height is larger than the camera/card dimensions (in which case `y` controls the position). A value of `0` means maximally to the left or top of the media, a value of `100` means maximally to the right or bottom of the media. See [CSS object-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) for technicals. See visualizations below. |
| `view_box` |           | A dictionary that may contain a `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` percentage (`0` - `100`) to precisely crop what part of the media to show by specifying a % inset value from each side. Browsers apply this cropping after `position` and `fit` have been applied. Unlike `zoom`, the user cannot dynamically zoom back out -- however the builtin media controls will work as normal. See visualizations below. Limited [browser support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_object-view-box): ![](../../images/browsers/chrome_16x16.png 'Google Chrome :no-zoom') ![](../../images/browsers/chromium_16x16.png 'Chromium :no-zoom') ![](../../images/browsers/edge_16x16.png 'Microsoft Edge :no-zoom')                                                                                                             |
| `zoom`     | `1.0`     | A value between `1.0` and `10.0` inclusive that defines how much additional "digital zoom" to apply to this camera by default. Unlike with `view_box` the user can easily "zoom back out". Often used in conjuction with `pan`. When zoomed in the [builtin browser media controls](../live.md?id=controls) will automatically be disabled (as otherwise they would be enlarged also).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## `ptz`

Configure the PTZ actions taken for a camera (not to be confused with configuration of the PTZ _controls_, see [Live PTZ Controls](../live.md?id=ptz) or [Media Viewer PTZ Controls](../media-viewer.md?id=ptz)). Manually configured actions override any auto-detected actions.

```yaml
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.office
    ptz:
      # [...]
```

### Movement types

Generally PTZ cameras/integrations may support two kinds of PTZ actions:

- `relative`: Single relative steps, e.g. "Pan to the left one step".
- `continuous`: Separate start and stop, e.g. "Start panning to the left", following by a later command "Stop panning".

The card supports both, and with the help of the
`r2c_delay_between_calls_seconds` and `c2r_delay_between_calls_seconds` can
translate between them where necessary. See the [ONVIF
specification](https://www.onvif.org/specs/srv/ptz/ONVIF-PTZ-Service-Spec.pdf)
for more details on the distinction between `relative` and `continuous`.

The card UI (e.g. PTZ controls) will always try to call the `continuous` variety
to allow for precise/smooth controls, and if unavailable will translate multiple
`relative` steps with optional delays between each step. Manually configured
[actions](../actions/README.md) may be configured to call either variety.

When PTZ actions are manually set in the config, they will replace the
auto-detected actions. For example if `actions_left` is set for a Frigate
camera, it will be used for all `left` PTZ actions even though Frigate cameras
natively support continuous actions (`actions_left_start`, `actions_left_stop`).

?> Frigate auto-detected PTZ actions will always be `continuous` as this is what
the integration currently offers.

Cameras / integrations that are slower to respond to relative steps may need to increase this value to avoid multiple simultaneous actions being sent. Cameras / integrations that are rapid to respond may need to decrease this value to increase the appearance of one single continuous motion.      |

### `presets`

Configures named PTZ presets. If a preset of this name is auto-detected, these configured actions will take precedence.

```yaml
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.office
    ptz:
      presets:
        [preset_name]:
          ? [action]
```

`[action]` is any [perform-action](../actions/stock/README.md?id=perform-action) action.

## `triggers`

The `triggers` block configures what triggers a camera. Triggering can be used
to activate an action (e.g. view a camera in live, reset the card to the default
view). See [`view.triggers`](../view.md?id=triggers) to control what happens when a
camera is triggered.

```yaml
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.office
    triggers:
      # [...]
```

| Option      | Default                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `entities`  |                              | Whether to not to trigger the camera when the state of any Home Assistant entity becomes active (i.e. state becomes `on` or `open`). This works for Frigate or non-Frigate cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `events`    | `[events, clips, snapshots]` | Whether to trigger the camera when `events` occur (whether or not media is available) or whenever updated `clips` or `snapshots` are detected. Detection support varies by camera [engine](engine.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `motion`    | `false`                      | Whether to not to trigger the camera by automatically detecting and using the motion `binary_sensor` for this camera. This autodetection only works for Frigate cameras, and only when the motion `binary_sensor` entity has been enabled in Home Assistant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `occupancy` | `false`                      | Whether to not to trigger the camera by automatically detecting and using the occupancy `binary_sensor` for this camera and its configured zones and labels. This autodetection only works for Frigate cameras, and only when the occupancy `binary_sensor` entity has been enabled in Home Assistant. If this camera has configured zones, only occupancy sensors for those zones are used -- if the overall _camera_ occupancy sensor is also required, it can be manually added to `entities`. If this camera has configured labels, only occupancy sensors for those labels are used. |
