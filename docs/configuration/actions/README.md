# `actions`

## Introduction to actions <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

`actions` is not a top-level configuration block, but can be used as part of
multiple other blocks.

Actions are pre-configured activities that can be triggered in response to a
variety of circumstances (e.g. tapping on a menu icon, double tapping on an
[element](../elements/README.md) or holding the mouse/tap down on a particular
[view](../view.md?id=supported-views)).

### Differences in actions between Frigate Card and Home Assistant

Both the Home Assistant frontend and the Frigate card cooperate to provide
action functionality. In general, the Frigate Card functionality is a superset
of that offered by stock Home Assistant.

Stock action functionality is used for Stock [Home Assistant picture
elements](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/picture-elements/). Extended
Frigate card behavior covers all other interactions on the Frigate card (e.g.
menu icon elements, submenus and actions on the card or views).

#### Custom action types: `start_tap` and `end_tap`

The card has partial support for two special action types `start_tap` and
`end_tap` which occur when a tap is started (e.g. mouse is pressed down /
touch begins), and ended (e.g. mouse released / touch ends) respectively. This
might be useful for PTZ cameras cameras to start/stop movement on touch. Network
latency may introduce unavoidable imprecision between `end_tap` and action
actually occurring.

#### Multiple actions

Extended Frigate card behavior supports a list of actions instead of a single
action, all of which will be handled. See [an example of multiple
actions](../../examples.md?id=multiple-actions).

## Card and view actions <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Actions may be attached to the card itself, to trigger action when the card
experiences a `tap`, `double_tap`, `hold`, `start_tap` or `end_tap` event.
Alternatively they can be configured on a per group-of-views basis, e.g. only
when `live` view is tapped.

| Configuration path      | Views to which it refers               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `image.actions`         | `image`                                |
| `live.actions`          | `live`                                 |
| `media_gallery.actions` | `clips`, `snapshots`, `recordings`     |
| `media_viewer.actions`  | `clip`, `snapshot`, `recording`        |
| `view.actions`          | All except `timeline` and `diagnostic` |

If an action is configured for both the whole card (`view.actions`) and a more
specific view (e.g. `live.actions`) then the actions are merged, with the more
specific overriding the less specific.

!> The card itself relies on user interactions to function (e.g. `tap` on
the menu should activate that button). Card or View actions are prevented from
being activated through standard interaction with menu buttons, next/previous
controls, thumbnails, etc, but in some cases this prevention is not possible
(e.g. embedded WebRTC card controls) -- in these cases duplicate actions may
occur with certain configurations (e.g. `tap`).

!> Card-wide actions are not supported on the `timeline` view, `diagnostics`
view nor when a info/error message is being displayed.
