# URL Actions

It is possible to pass the Frigate card one or more
[actions](../configuration/actions/README.md) from the URL (e.g. select a particular
camera, open the live view in expanded mode, etc).

### When actions are executed

The Frigate card will execute these actions in the following circumstances:

- On initial card load.
- On 'tab' change in a dashboard.
- When a `navigate` [action](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/actions/)
  is called on the dashboard (e.g. a button click requests navigation).
- When the user uses the `back` / `forward` browser buttons whilst viewing a
  dashboard.

## Instructions

To send an action to _all_ Frigate Cards on a dashboard:

```
[PATH_TO_YOUR_HA_DASHBOARD]?frigate-card-action.[ACTION]=[VALUE]
```

To send an action to a specific named Frigate Card:

```
[PATH_TO_YOUR_HA_DASHBOARD]?frigate-card-action.[CARD_ID].[ACTION]=[VALUE]
```

| Parameter | Description                                                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ACTION`  | One of the supported Frigate Card custom actions. See below.                                      |
| `CARD_ID` | When specified only cards that have a [`card_id`](../configuration/README.md) parameter will act. |
| `VALUE`   | An optional value to use with the `camera_select` and `live_substream_select` actions.            |

?> Both `.` and `:` may be used as the delimiter. If you use `:` some
browsers may require it be escaped to `%3A`.

!> If a dashboard has multiple Frigate cards on it, even if they are on
different 'tabs' within that dashboard, they will all respond to the actions
unless the action is targeted with a `CARD_ID` as shown above.

## Supported Actions

Only a subset of all [actions](../configuration/actions/README.md) are supported in URL form.
