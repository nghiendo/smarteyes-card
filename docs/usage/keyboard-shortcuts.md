# Keyboard Shortcuts

There are two ways to have the card respond to key input:

- As a convenience, the card supports a small number of built in shortcuts with pre-defined default bindings. See below for these built in shortcuts. Use the [`keyboard_shortcuts`](../configuration/view.md?id=keyboard_shortcuts) configuration to change their bindings.
- More generally, _any_ [action](../configuration/actions/README.md) can be configured to run in response to keyboard input as part of an [automation](../configuration/automations.md), even if that action does not have a pre-defined shortcut. See [keyboard automation example](../examples.md?id=responding-to-key-input) to show how to execute any arbitrary action(s) in response to keyboard activity.
