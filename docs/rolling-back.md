# Rolling Back

There may be many versions of this card (see [release philosophy](./developing.md?id=release-philosophy)). If you experience trouble with one version, you can always rollback to a prior version.

### Rolling Back in HACS

- Open your Home Assistant instance and navigate to `HACS` in the sidebar
- Choose "Frontend"
- Click on "Frigate Card"
- Click on the "Three dots menu"
- Choose "Redownload"
- Select the version you wish to change to
- Click "Download"
- Reload your browser

### Rolling Back Manually

If you didn't use `HACS` to install the card, you're on your own to roll it
back! Generally though this amounts to simply "replacing" an installation with
an older one, by following the [manual
installation](./advanced-installation.md?id=manual-installation) instructions
and simply choosing an older version to install.
